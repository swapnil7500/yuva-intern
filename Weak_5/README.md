# SPA Simulation Project

**Overview**

This project simulates a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without any frontend framework. It demonstrates dynamic routing, DOM manipulation, and smooth transitions, all handled on the client side.

##  Features

- ✅ Navigation without full page reload
- ✅ Client-side routing with `History API`
- ✅ Dynamic content loading using `fetch()`
- ✅ Smooth fade-in transitions
- ✅ Fully responsive layout

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Clicking on navigation links updates the browser URL using `history.pushState()`.
2. JavaScript captures the navigation event and dynamically loads the relevant HTML from the `/pages` folder.
3. The page content is replaced inside the `<main id="content">` container.
4. No full page reload occurs, simulating the behavior of modern SPAs.
